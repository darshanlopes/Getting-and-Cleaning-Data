# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
Read the test label and subjects
Read the training labels and subject
Read the data associated with training and test
merges the test and training datasets
read the features and extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
read the activity labels and replaces them in the datasets
calculates the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
write the tidy data 

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
